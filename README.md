      <summary>Investing Decisions Maker</summary>
        A Mamdani type fuzzy logic system named with six inputs and one output. 
        It's designed to assist in investment decision-making based on various financial indicators. 
        The inputs include metrics such as revenue growth, gross profit margin, and P/E ratio, each divided into linguistic terms like "negative," "average," and "high." 
        The output, "Type of Investment," provides linguistic categories such as "avoid," "risky," "worthy," and "unicorn" based on the inputs' fuzzy logic analysis. 
        The system's rules govern the mapping between input combinations and output categories, enabling nuanced investment recommendations.

        Here i test the program with a german stock for water transportation of containers.
        It has for the past 5 years: 11.97% revenue growth, 45.29% gross margin, 31.33% operationg margin, 30.35% net margin, 9.22 P/E and -35% price.
        The program decided that it has a score of 3.13 which is between "worthy" and "unicorn".
        I invested â‚¬100 in it for testing purposes and ended up with 30% profit for one month.
        This is not an investment advice.
